## steps

* Create react app
* Remove boilerplate  (delete all but the index.js)
* Update

### JSX Rules

* return single element
* div / section / article/ or Fragment
* use camelCase for Html Attribute
* className instead of class
* close every element
* formatting

### Gotchas
Look out for libraries that add style inline which prevents usage of css. This is not always a bad thing
Use css, but sometimes we want to get the learning done. 

And to comment out it looks like this in JSX
{/* foobar */}


### Props

### React hooks

if the topic begins with "Use" then it is a react hook
they must start with capital letter

* useState
* useEffect
* Conditional rendering
* Forms
* useRef
* useReducer
* Prop drilling
* Context API / useContext

### useEffect

a side effect is an action or something outside of the component
like fetching, events, signup list, etc

If you dont cleanup it will lead to a memory leak eventually
